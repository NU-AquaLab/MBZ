- Plugins:
  - Each plugin requires several different functions to work properly:
    - init (int pid, int (*req)(void* int))
      - basic initialization function
      - req is one of the structs defined in the plugin file (e.g. plugin.cpp) and outlines what the plugin wants (e.g. flow stats or ui data)
    - run()
      - function to run the basic plugin code, executed in separate thread
    - stop()
      - stop plugin (sets state.running = false)
    - deinit()
      - uninitialize the plugin
    - update(char *buf, int n)
      - called following a request to process a UI update plugin request 
    - procout(uint32_t dstip, uint16_t dstport, int *drop)
      - process outbound packet 
      - e.g. check IP against those to firewall
  - Setting up Plugins:
    - Instructions exist in README file
    - currently need to be deployed manually onto the device
      - three files are necessary for the plugin to be loaded properly:
        - config
          - set of lines w/ single integers indicating the needs of the plugin
        - <plugin>.jar (Android APK for UI code)
        - lib<plugin>.so (C++ shared library for native code)
    - the config file specifies what defined services the plugin requires
      - List of currently defined services are in the README file
      - future services can be added such as shared HTTP proxy, GPS, etc.
